# BOBcat

BOBcat is a “Black holes Orbiting Black holes catalog” that will be a
searchable, public-use database of SMBHB candidates.

The catalog will include a fully-referenced, comprehensive database of
candidate SMBHBs published in the literature, including relevant
queryable information such as sky location (right ascension and
declination), cosmological redshift, proposed binary signature,
proposed binary models, and any limitations on the binary orbital
parameters (chirp mass, mass ratio, frequency, orientation
parameters). Similar catalogs of other types of astronomical sources
are currently available, like PSRcat, FRBcat, Open Supernova Catalog,
etc. We are hoping to have BOBcat be something akin to those but for
SMBHBs. BOBcat will thus serve as a centralizing reference point for
pertinent information about SMBHB candidates in the literature. We
intend that it may serve at least two main communities in astronomy:
GW searchers/modelers (LISA and PTAs), and electromagnetic black-hole
hunters.
